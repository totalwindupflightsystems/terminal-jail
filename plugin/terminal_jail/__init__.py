"""
terminal-jail — PID namespace sandbox for Hermes terminal commands.

CURRENT LIMITATION (2026-07-20, HOOK-GAP-03): Hermes core does NOT expose a
pre-execution command-transform hook. The plugin's former command-wrapping
functions were removed in v1.1.x as dead code — they could not be wired to
command execution without a core change. The ``pre_tool_call`` hook can only
BLOCK or ALLOW tool calls — it cannot modify the command string.

Until Hermes core adds a pre-execution command-transform hook (see task
HOOK-GAP-01), this plugin provides:
- Observability via ``transform_terminal_output`` (logs wrapped commands post-exec)
- A pre_tool_call observer for tracking terminal tool usage
- Metrics export (``get_metrics`` / ``scripts/metrics-export.py``)
